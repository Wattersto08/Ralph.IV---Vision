- Python Script uses open CV to track faces, referancing their postion against the 0,0 position of the camera, 
  this then sends the X and Y offsets via serial, where the Cpp script maps and transfers the positions to the Servos
 
- in future itterations id like to add full chassis to rotate at a certain threshhold

- ROS support is intended for future updates.
